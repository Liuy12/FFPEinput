# FFPEinput

The tutorial aims to provide RNA input recommendations (RNA concentration and library concentration) for FFPE samples in order to generate adequate data for RNA-seq. Please refer to our [publication](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-1428294/v1/5f199ab7-8b30-4cf0-a3eb-296477271c8b.pdf?c=1647869411) for more details

## Background

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues have many advantages for identification of risk biomarkers, including wide availability and potential for extended follow-up endpoints. However, RNA derived from archival FFPE samples has limited quality. There are limited studies that provide insight for selection of FFPE samples of adequate quality. Here we identified parameters that determine which FFPE samples have the potential for successful RNA extraction, library preparation, and generation of usable RNAseq data.
